## Technical Analysis
1. Technology Stack Recommendations:
    - Frontend: React.js (with Redux for state management). React is a popular, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework. Node.js is a highly scalable, high-speed platform which can handle many requests at once. Express.js simplifies the task of writing server code.
    - Database: MongoDB. It's a NoSQL database which can handle large amounts of data and allows for high load. It's also flexible and scalable.
    - Cloud service: AWS or Google Cloud for hosting and other cloud services.
    - Version Control: Git, Github.
    - Testing: Jest for unit testing, Cypress for end-to-end testing.

2. Key Features to Implement:
    - User registration and authentication.
    - Dashboard to display different metrics (Like count, Share count, Comment count, etc.).
    - Real-time analytics: Update the dashboard in real-time as activities happen on the social media platforms.
